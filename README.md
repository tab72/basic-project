# Empty Project Template

This is an empty boilerplate for future HTML/CSS projects. Clone this repo to get started on a new project.

`git clone [repo URL here]

After cloning the repo, we'll need to set a new remote location. To do that, create a new GitHub repo and then use this command:

`git remote set-url origin [NEW-GITHUB-REPO-URL]

Now push to the new repo, and we're ready to go.
